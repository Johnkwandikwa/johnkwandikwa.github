		<p>Emma Watson has won the MTV Movie and TV award for best big-screen actor - the first gender-neutral prize the ceremony has given out. 

In her acceptance speech, the actress said winning the prize for her role in Beauty and the Beast was "very meaningful".

"To me, it indicates that acting is about the ability to put yourself in someone else's shoes, and that doesn't need to be separated into two different categories."

MTV announced the change to the categories earlier this year after Billions star Asia Kate Dillon raised the issue with the Emmys. 

When organisers asked the female-born star how they wanted to be considered, it proved a struggle because the performer identifies as gender non-binary.

What to go for - best actor or best actress?

    Mo Adeniran was eventually named the series winner, sealing a recording contract with Polydor.<br>

		<h2>Pepe the Frog 'is killed off to avoid being a hate symbol'</h2>
		<center><img src = "img/lab49.jpg"></img></center>
	</article>
	<aside id = "tablet2">
		<p>Online cartoon character Pepe the Frog appears to have been killed off by its creator in a bid to stop his image being hijacked by far-right groups. 

Pepe's creator Matt Furie over the weekend depicted the frog in a coffin, mourned by other members of his Boy's Club cartoon strip.

Furie recently complained that "a chilled frog" had become a hate symbol.

Pepe has recently been depicted as Adolf Hitler and as a member of the US white supremacist Ku Klux Klan group.

The alt-right group, a disparate group of right-wingers, has repeatedly shared Pepe re-workings on social media.

The frog made its debut in 2005.

Furie lamented in a recent article for Time magazine that it was a nightmare that his "blissfully stoned... peaceful frog-dude" in Boy's Club - who enjoyed "a simple life of snacks, soda and pulling his pants all the way down to go pee" - was now being used as a symbol of hate by racists and anti-Semites.

Recent efforts by Furie and Boy's Club fans to reclaim Pep were overshadowed by the the alt-right's movement's transformation of the character during the US elections last year when it claimed Donald Trump as its presidential candidate of choice. 

The movement has been described as an alternative to mainstream conservatism, but its proponents have repeatedly piled abuse at Jewish Americans and portrayed white people as oppressed. 

Mr Trump at one point re-tweeted a caricature depicting him as Pepe in October 2015, with the caption "You Can't Stump the Trump".
