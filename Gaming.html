	<aside id = "tablet2">
		<p>Cast back your mind to 2006, when the world was still waiting for the phenomenon of Grand Theft Auto IV to hit the streets. The plan as most people understood it was for the game to be an exclusive title for the PlayStation 3, which obviously would have been a big deal for Sony, and a raw one for Microsoft, which was trying to compete with their Xbox 360 console. But it didn't go down that way, despite the fact that the three previous installments of the Grand Theft Auto franchise – Grand Theft Auto III, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas – had debuted on the PlayStation 2. Video game industry analyst Michael Pachter once had an interview with gaming site Eurogamer where he gave the inside story on what happened:

"Microsoft paid Take-Two [Interactive] to make Grand Theft Auto IV non-exclusive. GTA IV was going to be a PS3 exclusive, but Microsoft paid Rockstar and Take-Two to make it a non-exclusive, and they paid them a lot."</p>

<p>How much is "a lot"? According to Pachter, the total figure came to $75 million, which included funding for two downloadable funding packs that began life as exclusives for the Xbox 360, but which eventually became available for other platforms as well.

The rest is video game history, and the GTA franchise continues to be a big seller for both Sony and Microsoft, and a Grand Theft Auto VI is rumored to be on the way.</p>

		<h2><strong>GTA 5 SHOULD GET SPIN-OFFS BEFORE GTA 6 ARRIVES<strong></h2>

	</article>
	<aside id = "tablet2">
		<p>The GTA franchise may only be at its fifth numbered entry, but there have been far more games than just five. So far, each numbered main game was followed by some kind of additional game or games, be they expansion packs or spin-off titles. The 3D era is composed of 5 games, of which only one is numbered. So why is everyone hot about GTA 6?

		 <center><img src="./img/lab65.jpg"></center>
		<p>With gaming journalism being what it is, pointless click-bait articles pepper their titles and slugs with nonsense like “GTA 6”, “Xbox Two” and “PS5” because they know that drives traffic, but all of this is baseless conjecture with zero substance. At most, a potentially reliable source has said that a new GTA title is in pre-production, but it’s not like that isn’t something we all know anyway.

Rockstar isn’t going to put their flagship franchise on ice, and the teams at North are likely in the early stages of the next heavy hitter. However fans are quick to assume that the next game will have a 6 in the title, even though Rockstar never followed one numbered entry with another.

While GTA 3 is lauded to be the entry which gained the franchise widespread renown, both Vice City and San Andreas are equally popular, with SA possibly being even more so than the other two. Spin-offs never enjoyed smaller popularity compared to main entries.s</p>

		<h2>From gaming to gambling: the rising risk of esports</h2>
		<center><img src = "img/lab66.jpeg"></img></center>
	</article>
	<aside id = "tablet2">
		<p>
		For years parents have been concerned about the amount of time their children spend playing video games but there’s more to worry about now than their square eyes and a lack of fresh air.

The popularity of esports tournaments, where players compete against one another on the latest computer games, is booming but as with any fast-growing industry it is attracting some undesirable interest including from illicit gambling websites.

The total number of hours spent watching esports events exceeded 6 billion globally in 2016, up 19pc compared to the year before, according to a study by IHS Markit.

As esports events have risen in popularity - and profitability - a growing number of businesses have sprouted up in a bid to leverage the trend’s success for their own gain.

The Gambling Commission secured the first prosecution of its kind earlier this year of two men running the unlicensed gambling website FutGalaxy.com which allowed gamblers - including people under the age of 18 - to use a virtual currency to bet on the outcome of esports matches.

After being shown footage of a 12-year-old boy gambling on the site, District Judge McGarva described it as “horrific” and added the video had “hit home to me how serious this is”.

The Gambling Commission said since November 2014, it had contacted 100 unlicensed online gambling sites and 16 of these were related to the issue of gambling using virtual currencies on esports tournaments.

It added unregulated third-party websites were on the rise and that one US report estimated the global ‘skins’ gambling market - where in-game items such as digital guns and knives are used as a proxy for gambling chips - was worth between $3.9bn and $5.1bn in 2016.

		<p>Mr Etches said while it might be difficult to identify too many young problem gamblers now he was worried the country would “reach a tipping point” if the authorities did not grasp control of the burgeoning trend.

Ian Smith is the first esports integrity commissioner and was appointed last year to head the Esport Integrity Coalition, known as ESIG.

He sympathises with the concerns about the effect the thin boundary between esports and gambling could have in the near future.

Mr Smith said while he felt the issue surrounding betting using virtual currencies, or skins, was fading, its prevalence between 2013 and last year had created a problem that would endure.

“Lots of young people learned how to gamble in a way they would not have done with other sports,” he said.
