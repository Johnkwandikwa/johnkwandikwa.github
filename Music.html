				<h2>mtv awards 2017</h2>
				<p>The MTV Video Music Awards will return to the West Coast this year. The network announced Thursday (April 19) the event will be held Aug. 27 at the Forum in Inglewood, California, at 8 p.m. EST.

				<h2>Katy Perry's new single sparks 'homophobic' backlash</h2>
				<p>Katy Perry has found herself in deep water with her new single Bon App√©tit after it was confirmed that she is collaborating on it with controversial rap group Migos.

Last month the hip-hop trio refused to support the coming out of rapper iLoveMakonnen in an interview with Rolling Stone magazine in which they claimed that it was an example of "the world being f***ed up".

"This world is not right," said band member Takeoff before one of the trio hastily clarified that.....<a href="#">readmore</a></p>

				<h2>Miley Cyrus flashes engagement ring in new video</h2>
				
				<p>Miley Cyrus is back and returning to her country-music roots with a brand new song in which she pays homage to her fiance Liam Hemsworth. 

While 24-year-old Cyrus' betrothed does not feature in the video he is subtly hinted at in her romantic lyrics, the way video is shot, and in several flashes of her diamond engagement ring. 

Cyrus and Hemsworth began dating in 2010, became engaged in 2012, but parted ways a year later. Cyrus soon became a notable figure on the party scene and spoke openly about her drug use and saucy antics, however the star has calmed down since she reunited with Hemsworth last year. 

In the song, Cyrus sings that she never thought three years ago - referring to when they called off their engagement in 2013 - that she would have been writing a song about him, "But here I am, next to you"..</p>

				<p>he said: "People are going to talk about me if I come out of a restaurant with Liam. So why not put the power back in my relationship and say, 'This is how I feel'".

Cyrus, who has ditched the PVC bikinis and twerking, also revealed that she wanted to reach across the political divide in the US, saying: "I like talking to people that don't agree with me, but I don't think I can do that in an aggressive way.</p>
