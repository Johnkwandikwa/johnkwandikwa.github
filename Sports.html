		<p>McLaren's Fernando Alonso says Honda is risking its reputation with its poor performance this year.

The Spaniard suffered an engine failure on his first lap in practice at the Spanish Grand Prix, the latest in a series of problems for Honda in 2017.

Alonso, who has half his $40m (Â£31.1m) salary paid by Honda, has had engine issues in three of four races.

"It is not my career, my ability, my image [at stake]. It is their career, ability, money and image," Alonso said. 

"I try to support the team and drive as fast as I can, but the problem is not entirely mine. It is much bigger for them."

As well as Alonso's problems, team-mate Stoffel Vandoorne received a grid penalty at the last race in Russia because he had already used more engine parts than is allowed for an entire season.

Alonso, whose engine failed on his way to the grid in Russia, said that his problem on Friday was "in a way not a surprise", adding: "In Russia on Sunday we could not manage to complete the formation lap and here we would not complete the out lap."

He said he hoped that the engine would prove reliable in the race - the reverse of what has happened to him at previous grands prix this year.

'If we can't compete, he will leave'

The problems are mounting for Honda as attention already begins to focus on the driver market for next year.

Alonso is out of contract at the end of this season and has said he wants to stay in F1 if he can find a car that will allow him to fight at the front. He says he will not take a decision until September or October.

McLaren executive director Zak Brown told BBC Sport: "If we can build him a competitive car, he will stay. If we cannot, he will leave."

The team are doing their best to persuade Alonso to re-sign and have put together a programme for him to compete in the Indianapolis 500 later this month.

The 35-year-old is flying straight to America after the Spanish Grand Prix on Sunday to start practice for the Indy 500 on Monday.

Honda's F1 engine is said to be about 120bhp behind the pace-setting Mercedes and Ferrari units, which produce close to 1000bhp, and there are widespread rumours that Mercedes are to assist Honda with their engine technology in an attempt to help the Japanese company catch up.

But Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said: "We are not doing anything for Honda, that is the current status quo.

"So unless that situation changes, I don't want to contribute to rumours out there that are false and I think are damaging for Honda, and create hard standpoints from teams or other stakeholders. We will see what happens."

		<h2><strong>Chelsea worthy champions<strong></h2>
		<center><img src = "img/lab55.jpg"></img></center>
	</article>
	<aside id = "tablet2">
		<p>Chelsea's celebrations were fully deserved - the culmination of a superb season's work by Conte and his squad.

They had to work hard for victory against a West Brom side that demonstrated all the qualities that have made this such a satisfactory season for them but, as so often, Chelsea got the job done.

The Blues' main attacking threats struggled to find a spark, with Eden Hazard's frustration summed up with one long-range shot that went out for a corner, but Conte's side found a way to win, illustrating once again why they are worthy champions.

The losses at home to Liverpool and at Arsenal in September that hinted at early struggles seemed an age away, as did the surprise defeat by struggling Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge, and the setback at Manchester United.

Chelsea, even when not at their best, proved themselves the strongest and most complete side in the Premier League - and they proved it again on a night they were tested.

		Conte's magic touch does it again

Conte's fingerprints are all over this title triumph - and his sure touch was on show again to fashion the victory they needed to get over the line with two games to spare.

The Italian knew his side needed a catalyst to break down West Brom, and it came with the introduction of Batshuayi and Willian for Hazard and Pedro with 15 minutes left. It was Batshuayi, an outsider for so long this season, who was the match-winner.

Conte's masterstroke should have come as no surprise given the manner in which he has marshalled his forces, particularly the crucial switch to a three-man defence in September that turned Chelsea's season around and started a run of 13 straight league wins that led to the title.

No praise is too high for the 47-year-old, who took over a squad that looked broken after ending last season in 10th place and with the shadow of Jose Mourinho's sacking still hanging over the club.

		<h2>Soccer: Malaysia appeal against North Korea match in Pyongyang</h2>
		
	</article>
	<aside id = "tablet2">
		<p>
The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) is considering Malaysia's appeal against having to play an Asian Cup qualifier against North Korea in Pyongyang next month, the governing body said on Wednesday.

Diplomatic relations between the countries had soured following the assassination of Kim Jong-nam, the estranged elder half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in February.
 
As tensions rose over Kim's killing, the Malaysian national team was barred from traveling to North Korea, preventing them from playing the match originally scheduled on March 28.

The AFC said on Monday that the postponed Group B match would be played on June 8 following confirmation from the Football Association of Malaysia that no government travel restrictions are in place.
