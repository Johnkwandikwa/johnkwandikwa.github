Emmanuel Macron, France's youthful president, has only been a world leader for less than three weeks. 


Yet he's already seized a role as a bastion of liberal global values, staring down both US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, two of the biggest threats to the political consensus that has dominated Western politics for decades

Macron's most audacious intervention yet came on Thursday night, in a remarkable video address to the American people responding to Trump's withdrawing the US from the Paris climate accord that quickly went viral. The message: Trump is an outlier against the values that made his own nation great, despite his mantra that only he can restore US greatness.


"Tonight I wish to tell the United States, France believes in you. The world believes in you. I know that you are a great nation," Macron said in the video against a backdrop of the French tricolor and the flag of the European Union.


"I know your history, our common history," he said, calling on scientists, engineers and "responsible citizens" disappointed by Trump's decision to find a "second homeland" in France to work together on concrete solutions to save the planet.



Macron's flagrant foray into domestic US politics mined outrage among Trump's US opponents

A Canadian woman who pleaded guilty Thursday to killing eight assisted-living facility residents while she was a nurse told a detective in a video confession that she thought God wanted to use her.


Elizabeth Tracey Mae Wettlaufer said she injected patients with lethal dosages of insulin when she poisoned residents who ranged in age from 75 to 90 in two Ontario facilities between 2007 and 2014.


According to CNN partner CBC News, Wettlaufer, 49, told an interrogator that she was angry with 
According to CNN partner CBC News, Wettlaufer, 49, told an interrogator that she was angry with life. 


In the video, played during her one-day trial Thursday, she says she knew the difference between right and wrong. But she said she would get a "red surging with God telling me this is the one."


She also picked some victims because they were "mean," CBC News reported. 



Victims James Silcox, 84, Maurice Granat, 84, Gladys Millard, 87, Helen Matheson, 95, Mary Zurawinski, 96, Helen Young, 90 and Maureen Pickering, 79, were residents at Caressant Care Nursing and Retirement Home in Woodstock, where Wettlaufer worked.


Arpad Horvath, 75, resided at Meadow Park Long Term Care in London, Ontario. which also was among the places Wettlaufer worked. Horvath died on August 31, 2014.


Wettlaufer also confessed to trying to kill others, the video shows.


Authorities received a tip in September that a nurse had killed multiple patients, which led to Wettlaufer's arrest, police in southwestern Ontario have said.


Wettlaufer said after she killed five people she began to doubt God was telling her to kill

		<h2>Oil Burst winner: Saudi Arabia Tech scene</h2>

Few places in the world have felt the pain of low oil prices like Saudi Arabia.

Cuts to the bloated public sector have changed the economic prospects for many Saudis. But one local industry is emerging as a winner from the oil bust. 



The oil crunch is proving a "blessing in disguise" for the country's young tech sector, said Abdulrahman Tarabzouni, a former regional manager for Google (GOOGL, Tech30). 

Saudi Arabia is pumping tens of billions of dollars into technology in an attempt to diversify its economy and become less reliant on volatile oil prices. 

"Any individual has a shot now at creating something extremely valuable and accessible to the rest of the world," Tarabzouni told young entrepreneurs and business leaders at a recent forum in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. 

Many local and national governments dream of imitating Silicon Valley's success, but the Saudis at least have the cash to make a serious attempt. 

The kingdom's sovereign wealth fund has already announced plans to pour $45 billion into a tech fund with Japan's Softbank (SFTBF). In June, the Saudi fund invested $3.5 billion in Uber. 

Saudi Arabia has also set up tech incubators and established venture capital funds with headquarters in Riyadh and offices in Menlo Park, California. Among them is Riyadh Taqnia Capital, which has committed to investing over $100 million in local tech firms.
