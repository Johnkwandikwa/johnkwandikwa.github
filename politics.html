    By: Mohamed Wysch</h2>

	</article>
	<aside id = "tablet2">
		<p>US President Donald Trump held out the possibility on Sunday of using trade as a lever to secure Chinese
    cooperation against North Korea and suggested Washington might deal with Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programmes
    on its own if need be.
    The comments, in an interview published on Sunday in the Financial Times, appeared designed to pressure Chinese
    President Xi Jinping in the run-up to his visit to Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida this week.
    "China has great influence over North Korea. And China will either decide to help us with North Korea,
    or they won't. And if they do that will be very good for China, and if they don't it won't be good for anyone,
    " Trump was quoted as saying, according to an edited transcript published by the newspaper.
    Asked if he would consider a "grand bargain" in which China pressured Pyongyang in return for a guarantee that the US
    would later remove troops from the Korean peninsula, the newspaper quoted Trump as saying: "Well, if China is not
    going to solve North Korea, we will. That is all I am telling you."
        
		</p>

		<p>Trump downplayed the significance of North Korea's "small missile launch," which occurred early in the day. But when asked by host John Dickerson if he would consider military action in response to another nuclear test, Trump responded: "I don't know. I mean, we'll see." 

Still, Trump expressed tepid admiration for North Korea's leader.

"People are saying, 'Is he sane?' I have no idea," the President said, before noting Kim Jong Un's rise to power at a young age. 

"So obviously, he's a pretty smart cookie," he said. "But we have a situation that we just cannot let -- we cannot let what's been going on for a long period of years continue."


Later, when asked at during a factory tour before a rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to mark his 100th day in office what his message on North Korea is, Trump told reporters: "You'll soon find out, won't you?"

Pressed on whether that meant military action, Trump said, "You'll soon find out."

The missile launched Saturday blew up over land in North Korean territory, said US Navy Cmdr. Dave Benham, a spokesman for the US Pacific Command.

        While a special team from the Maldivian Police Service has left for Bangladesh today to join the investigation, Minister Azleen

		<p id="Maldivian"  style="display:none; font-weight: bold"><a href="#" name="Maldivian"></a>An autopsy report, conducted by three doctors at Rajshahi Medical College Hospital, ruled Raudha’s death as suicide shortly after she was buried on Saturday. Her family have rejected it.

Her brother Rayann claims: “In their first report, it said that there were strangulation marks, but they later dismissed it saying they were 'birthmarks'. But she does not have a birthmark on her neck.

“We've seen her bruised body, her tightly-held fists and hand marks on her neck as if somebody strangled her. When we raised these issue with the police, they dismissed it.”

According to police reports, students who discovered Raudha’s body broke into her room which was locked from the inside.

But her family have disputed this, claiming there was no evidence of a forced entry.

Rayann said: “We went inside Raudha’s room and checked the locks on the door - there was no sign of a break-in - no cracks, dents on the door.

“Authorities said students banged on the door and the two locks of the door just slipped down but that’s not possible. We demonstrated it. We banged on the door and the locks didn’t move an inch. I would love an explanation for this.”

		<h2>Emmanuel Macron: French president-elect to fight 'forces of division'</h2>
		<center><img src = "img/lab46.jpg"></img></center>
	</article>
	<aside id = "tablet2">
		<p>Emmanuel Macron has vowed to fight "the forces of division that undermine France" after easily winning the run-off election for the French presidency.

The centrist candidate, 39, defeated the far right's Marine Le Pen, winning 66.1% of the vote to her 33.9%.

Acknowledging his victory, Mr Macron told supporters he wanted to ensure Le Pen voters "no longer have a reason to vote for an extremist position".

The sense of relief among European Union leaders has been palpable

		</p>

		<center><img src = "img/lab45.jpg"></img></center>

		<p>She said the election had shown a division between "patriots and globalists" and called for the emergence of a new political force.

Ms Le Pen said her National Front party needed to renew itself and that she would start the "deep transformation of our movement", vowing to lead it into next month's parliamentary elections. 

<strong>Emmanuel Macron has triggered a political earthquake in French politics.</strong>

A year ago, he was a member of the government of one of the most unpopular French presidents in history. 

Now, at 39, he has won France's presidential election, defeating first the mainstream centre left and centre right and now the far right as well.

He got lucky

No doubt about it, Mr Macron was carried to victory in part by the winds of fortune. 

A public scandal knocked out the initial frontrunner, centre-right candidate François Fillon; and Socialist candidate Benoît Hamon, already on the left fringe of the party, suffered a very public drubbing as traditional voters looked elsewhere.

		<h2>Vietnam sacks top official for PetroVietnam 'violation'</h2>
		<center><img src = "img/lab47.jpg"></img></center>
	</article>
	<aside id = "tablet2">
		<p>A top Vietnamese official has been sacked for "violations" while running national oil and gas firm PetroVietnam, in a rare public censure by the ruling Communist Party.

The government said on Sunday that Dinh La Thang, 57, was no longer part of the top decision-making Politburo.

Mr Thang's alleged misconduct was first leaked on social media last year.

His sacking comes amid a wider crackdown on PetroVietnam, the country's largest enterprise.

It is extremely uncommon for a Politburo member to lose their place in the one-party state. Since Vietnam started economic reforms in 1986, only two other Politburo members have been dismissed.

'Serious violations'

Mr Thang is said to have committed the violations between 2009 and 2011 while he was chairman of PetroVietnam.

Last September, writer Huy Duc attacked Mr Thang on Facebook with articles accusing the politician of being responsible for a recent huge loss at PetroVietnam.

Although Huy Duc's articles, which seemed to be based on leaked documents, polarised public opinion on the internet, the issues he raised were not reported in state media.

In late April, the Central Inspection Committee, the top watchdog of the party, suddenly announced it had investigated and held Mr Thang responsible for "serious" violations at PetroVietnam.

The party's inspectors accused Mr Thang of allowing PetroVietnam to make loans to the local Ocean Bank that caused "serious losses" to the company.

They also said Mr Thang had advised the prime minister "to designate many bidding packages that failed to meet legal regulations".


On Sunday, a government statement said more than 90% of the party's central committee had voted to remove Mr Thang.

It said he had committed "serious violations in his leadership, command and staff works", which "hurt the Party's reputation" and caused "a loss of confidence" among people and party members.

<h3>Rising star</h3>

Mr Thang, a former transport minister, became a member of the new Politburo at the party congress last year and was made the party's chief of Ho Chi Minh City, the country's largest city and commercial hub formerly known as Saigon. 

The party is expected to soon name a new party chief for the city, a position always held by a Politburo member.

He was catapulted into political stardom for being unusually outspoken among normally reticent officials, and was known for his forthright rhetoric on state media.

His fall from grace follows other arrests at PetroVietnam and linked companies.

Another former PetroVietnam chairman was arrested in 2015 and later expelled from the Communist Party. Three other senior executives are also facing possible sanctions.

Last year four senior employees at a construction subsidiary of the firm were prosecuted for mismanagement that allegedly cost the company $150m (£116m).

Communist Party chief Nguyen Phu Trong, who is effectively the most powerful man in Vietnam, is serving his second term. He has launched an anti-corruption campaign and has issued resolutions aimed at improving ethical conduct among party members.

		<h2>Trump Fires FBI Director James Comey</h2>
		<center><iframe width="100%" height="400px" src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSWcIAA6abA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> </center>

WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump on Tuesday fired FBI Director James Comey, who had been leading an investigation into whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia to influence the presidential election.


Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a former top adviser to Trump’s campaign, and recently confirmed Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein recommended Comey be removed from his post in letters to Trump Tuesday. Sessions has recused himself from FBI investigations into the Russia matter and the Trump campaign.


 

- ADVERTISEMENT -




Comey, a Republican who formerly served as deputy attorney general during the President George W. Bush administration, had been leading the FBI’s investigation into possible ties between Trump associates and Moscow since July.


Presidents have the legal authority to fire FBI directors, who normally serve 10-year terms that span administrations. Comey was confirmed by the Senate in a nearly unanimous vote in July 2013, and was nearly four years into his term. He is only the second FBI director in history to be formally terminated, after William S. Sessions, who was fired by President Bill Clinton in 1993.


Comey learned of his ouster from TV, and initially thought it was a joke, according to several news reports. The New York Times reported that he was speaking to FBI employees in Los Angeles at the time, and that Trump’s dismissal letter was delivered later.




Democrats called for a special prosecutor to investigate the Russia matter.


Rep. Adam Schiff (Calif.), ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, suggested Comey’s firing could amount to interference with the FBI’s Russia investigation.


“The decision by a President whose campaign associates are under investigation by the FBI for collusion with Russia to fire the man overseeing that investigation, upon the recommendation of an Attorney General who has recused himself from that investigation, raises profound questions about whether the White House is brazenly interfering in a criminal matter,” Schiff wrote in a statement.


Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Comey’s actions “called into question the trust and political independence of the FBI,” and said the bureau had been slow to provide answers to his questions.


Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) said he was “troubled by the timing and reasoning” behind the firing. “I have found Comey to be a public servant of the highest order, and his dismissal further confuses an already difficult investigation by our Committee,” Burr said in a statement. 


Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, called Trump’s actions a “Tuesday Night Massacre,” a reference to former President Richard Nixon’s 1973 firing of Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox.


“Today’s action by President Trump completely obliterates any semblance of an independent investigation into Russian efforts to influence our election, and places our nation on the verge of a constitutional crisis,” Conyers said. “Today’s actions reek of a cover up and appear to be part of an ongoing effort by the Trump White House to impede the investigation into Russian ties and interference in our elections.”


Trump’s letter dismissing Comey told him “you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau.” 


“The FBI is one of our Nation’s most cherished and respected institutions and today will mark a new beginning for our crown jewel of law enforcement,” Trump said in a statement.




Deputy White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said later on Fox News that Comey’s firing wouldn’t cause “any change or disruption” in the FBI’s Russia-related investigations. But the “bigger point,” she said, is that “it’s time to move on.”

“When are they going to let that go,” Huckabee Sanders told Fox’s Tucker Carlson. “It’s been going on for nearly a year, frankly it’s kind of getting absurd. There’s nothing there, we’ve heard that time and time again, we’ve heard it in the testimonies earlier this week, we’ve heard it for the last 11 months. 


Comey had been ensnared in controversy for months over his handling of the FBI’s investigations into the Russia matter and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server.


“Almost everyone agrees the Director made serious mistakes; it is one of the few issues that unites people of diverse perspectives,” Rosenstein wrote in his letter to Trump.


When the FBI concluded its investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server in July, Comey took the unusual step of holding a press conference, explaining the FBI’s reasoning for recommending no criminal charges be brought against the then-Democratic nominee. 


Democrats and some former Justice Department staffers criticized Comey, who spent the bulk of the press conference criticizing Clinton’s handling of classified emails, for speaking publicly about the result of a criminal investigation. Then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch had said at the time that she would accept the findings of FBI agents leading the investigation.  


But three months later, and just days before the election, Comey reignited the Clinton email controversy. On Oct. 28, he sent a letter to congressional leaders explaining that the FBI was investigating newly discovered Clinton emails. The letter leaked immediately, and Clinton fell in the polls. 


Two days before the election, Comey told Congress that the FBI had discovered no evidence that changed its recommendation against criminal charges for Clinton. But the damage was done. Many Clinton staffers blame the Oct. 28 letter for her loss.
